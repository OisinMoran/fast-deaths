# Death tolls from famously rapid projects
_Are things only slower because deaths are less acceptable?_

Some of the following examples are taken from [Patrick Collison's nicely curated list of fast projects](https://patrickcollison.com/fast). They are the ones for which I could find a readily available figure for the deaths involved in the _creation_ phase of the projectâ€”the bit we care about in terms of speed.

Project | Speed (days) | Deaths
--- | ---: | ---:
P-80 Shooting Star | 143 | 2
The Spirit of St. Louis | 60 | 0
The Eiffel Tower | 793 | 1
The Alaska Highway | 234 | 30
The Empire State Building | 410 | 5
The New York Subway | 1709 | 16
The Golden Gate Bridge | 1603 | 11

This simple README is open to PRs to correct any figures, add any more examples (especially instances with good sources 


For the record, I don't think our increasing reverance for life is the main driving factor for our manufacturing malaise, and would lean toward the increased bureaucracy side of things.

We already do have some implicit acceptance for trading off deaths for speed. In driving for example, if speed limits were half what they are there would be a lot fewer road deaths. In some other areas, like airport security, we're probably already at the limits of how slow we can go...
